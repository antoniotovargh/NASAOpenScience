# Team Cosmic Fallout: Analyzing the Potential Damage of Asteroid Impacts

### Description of Research:

> This project aims to estimate the damage radius of potential asteroid impacts. Our central hypothesis is that asteroids have the potential to damage cities. To explore this, we analyzed a comprehensive list of asteroid observations with a trajectory close to earth between 2024 and 2026. Using the asteroid's attributes such as size and velocity, we calculated the potential impact.

### Objectives:

1. **Hypothesis Testing:** To examine whether an asteroid impact can damage a city.

2. **Data Visualization:** To develop a suite of visualizations that represent the damage radius of an asteroid impact and explore patterns or correlations between asteroid size, kinetic energy and the damage radius.

### Methodology:

1. **Data Collection:** We utilized a dataset containing numerous asteroid observations which included asteroid attributes such as sizes and velocities. Our data was sourced from NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a reliable data source.

2. **Data Preparation:** The dataset was cleaned and further populated with results processed by calculations necessary for our research. 

3. **Visualization Techniques:** A series of visualization methods were used to interpret our results. First, we created a visual map of the damage radius of the asteroid impact. We also created a pivot table showcasing the distribution of asteroid sizes. We also developed a linear regression model showcasing the asteroid sizes and their kinetic energies. 

4. **Statistical Analysis:** We developed statistical analysis to showcase the relationship between different asteroid attributes. 

### Results:

The visualizations generated by our project provide clear insights into potential asteroid impacts. Our project successfully calculated and demonstrated the damage radius in reference to a city. Our calculations also suggest that most asteroids have a small diameter of less than 150m and have a small damage radius. This was evident from a linear regression model showing most data points clustered towards smaller diameter sizes. 


### Conclusion:

The project successfully demonstrated a visual description of asteroid impacts. The comprehensive data suggests that most asteroids are small in diameter and have the potential to create a small damage radius on impact.

## Terminology

- **Open Science**: A movement to make scientific research, data, and dissemination accessible to all. It encompasses four key components:
  - **Open Data**: Data that is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and share.
  - **Open Code**: Source code that is made available to the public, allowing others to use, modify, and distribute it.
  - **Open Source**: Software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.
  - **Open Results**: The outcomes of research, including publications and data, that are freely accessible to the public.
- **FAIR Principles**: Guidelines that ensure that research data is:
  - **Findable**: Data should be easy to find by both humans and computers, with metadata that clearly describes the data.
  - **Accessible**: Data should be retrievable by authorized users, using standardized protocols.
  - **Interoperable**: Data should be compatible with other datasets and tools, allowing for integration and analysis across various platforms.
  - **Reusable**: Data should be well-documented and licensed for reuse, allowing others to replicate or build upon the research.

## Workshop Details and Progress

### Day 1: Dataset Exploration and Initial Focus

We began our research by searching Kaggle for datasets using the keyword "Asteroid." After reviewing several large datasets, we identified crater formation as our initial focus. By the end of the day, we had defined our first research question:

<strong>
"How large of a crater would an asteroid create upon impacting Earth?"
</strong>

### Day 2: Challenges and Pivoting the Research

On Day 2, we attempted to compile datasets to study crater impacts but hit a major roadblock. Despite testing different formulas and datasets, we realized the calculations were nearly impossible due to missing variables (e.g., asteroid composition, impact angle or etc). After team discussions and mentor feedback, we concluded:
 
- Crater analysis was unfeasible with available data.
- We needed to shift focus to a measurable aspect of asteroids.
 
By day’s end, we decided to explore kinetic energy calculations instead.

### Day 3: Validating Our Hypothesis

Due to time limitations and lack of progress, we pivoted to a new direction with the following research questions:
 
- "What is the kinetic energy of an asteroid before it hits Earth?"
 
Steps taken to calculate:
 - Filtering datasets for asteroid diameter, velocity, and mass.
 - Used Kinetic Energy Formula 
 - Prepared data of historical impacts (e.g., Hiroshima and Chixalub).
 
We ended the day with preliminary calculations and a clear path forward.

### Day 4: Data Finalization and Presentation Preparation

On the final day, we:

- Cleaned and streamlined the dataset, removing irrelevant columns.
- Selected comparison benchmarks:
  - Nuclear events (Hiroshima, Tsar Bomba).
  - Past asteroid impacts (Chixalub).
- Began designing the presentation to visualize:
- Kinetic energy comparisons.
- Key learnings about asteroid threats.
 
We finalized the main components of our research.

### Day 5: Presentation Day

On the final day, we:

-Refined slides.
-Added citations
- Presented our project successfully, emphasizing:

- Our adaptive research process.
- The power of open-source asteroid data.

## Research Questions:

- What is the size distribution of asteroids?
- How many of these asteroids are dangerous?
- What is the damage radius of a potential asteroid impact?
---

## Hypothesis:

> Asteroid impacts can damage an entire city. 

---

## Our Observations:

- **Kinetic Energy**: We observed that the graph shows an exponential curve in the relationship between kinetic energy and the diameter of the asteroid. 

- Frequency: We found that most asteroids have a diameter less than 150m.

- Damage: According to our calculations, we observed that even smaller impact asteroids have the potential to damage a city. 

- **

Each observation was derived from the analysis conducted through Python and Pandas, with significant guidance from Dr. Antonio.
